tools.bbuild
========================================

## Babashka maintained fork of tools.build

> WARNING: this work is experimental and should be used with caution!

This fork of `tools.build` works with babashka. To make it compatible, the
following changes were introduced:

- The `clojure.tools.deps` library is replaced with
  [tools-deps-native](https://github.com/borkdude/tools-deps-native-experiment)
  which is used as a [pod](https://github.com/babashka/pods).

- `compile-clj` uses `clojure.core/munge` instead of `clojure.lang.Compiler/munge`

- `install` uses a helper from
  [tools-deps-native](https://github.com/borkdude/tools-deps-native-experiment)
  to construct maven objects.

- `javac` shells out to `javac` rather than using `javax.tools.JavaCompiler`

## Usage

Ensure you have [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) 1.0.169 or later.

In your `bb.edn` add `:paths ["."]` to add `build.clj` to your babashka classpath.
Also add this library to `bb.edn`:

``` clojure
io.github.babashka/tools.bbuild {:git/sha "<sha>"}
```

Create a `build.clj`:

``` clojure
(ns build
  (:require [clojure.tools.build.api :as b]))

(def version "0.1.0")
(def class-dir "target/classes")

(defn basis [_]
  (b/create-basis {:project "deps.edn"}))

(defn clean [_]
  (b/delete {:path "target"}))

(defn write-pom [{:keys [basis]}]
  (b/write-pom
   {:basis     basis
    :src-dirs  ["src"]
    :class-dir class-dir
    :lib 'my/example
    :version version}))

(defn jar [{:keys [basis]}]
  (b/copy-dir {:src-dirs ["src"]
               :target-dir class-dir})
  (b/jar
   {:basis     basis
    :src-dirs  ["src"]
    :class-dir class-dir
    :main      "example.core"
    :jar-file  (format "target/example-%s.jar" version)}))
```

Then run e.g. `bb -x build/jar` to produce a jar file.

## Tests

To run tests, run `bb test`. This assumes that the `tools-deps-native` pod is on
your PATH.

Here follows the original README.
