tools.bbuild
========================================

## Babashka maintained fork of tools.build

> WARNING: this work is experimental and should be used with caution!

This fork of `tools.build` works in babashka. To make it compatible, the
following changes with the original tools.build were introduced:

- `compile-clj` changes to use clojure.core/munge instead of the
  Compiler internal.

- `install` changes to use a helper from tools-deps-native-experiment to
  construct maven objects.

- `javac` changes to use the javac command line.

## Usage

Ensure you have [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) 0.6.5 or later.

Download or build
[tools-deps-native](https://github.com/borkdude/tools-deps-native-experiment)
and put the binary on your path.

To use with babashka, add this to your `bb.edn`:

``` clojure
{:deps  {io.github.babashka/tools.bbuild
         {:git/sha "4803c45baf274143aeb185ad5b9843a23a5a08e7"}
         borkdude/spartan.spec
         {:git/url "https://github.com/borkdude/spartan.spec"
          :sha     "12947185b4f8b8ff8ee3bc0f19c98dbde54d4c90"}}
 :tasks {:requires    ([babashka.pods :as pods]
                       [spartan.spec]
                       [clojure.tools.build.api :as b])
         -tools.build {:task (do
                               (pods/load-pod "tools-deps-native")
                               (require '[clojure.tools.deps.alpha :as deps])
                               (require '[clojure.tools.build.api :as b]))}
         clean        {:depends [-tools.build]
                       :task    (b/delete {:path "target"})}
         write-pom    {:depends [-tools.build]
                       :task    (let [deps-file (clojure.java.io/file
                                                 "deps.edn")
                                      deps-edn  (deps/slurp-deps deps-file)
                                      basis     (deps/create-basis
                                                 {:project deps-edn})]
                                  (b/write-pom
                                   {:basis     basis
                                    :src-dirs  [ "src"]
                                    :class-dir "target/classes"
                                    :lib       'my/project
                                    :version   "1.0.0"}))}}}
```
